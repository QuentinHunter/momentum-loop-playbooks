# PHASE 2: ACTIVATE (First Engagement)
## The W.A.R.M System™ Playbook

**Purpose:** Turn cold leads into warm, qualified prospects ready to buy

**Core Problem Solved:** High drop-off rates, leads going cold, no engagement after opt-in

---

## THE W.A.R.M SYSTEM™ OVERVIEW

```
W - Welcome Sequences
A - Assess & Qualify
R - Respond & Nurture
M - Momentum Building
```

**When to Deploy:** When you're generating leads but they're not engaging, booking calls, or moving forward.

---

## COMPONENT 1: WELCOME SEQUENCES

### What It Is
The automated series of touchpoints (email, SMS, retargeting) that onboard new leads in the first 24-72 hours.

### Why It Matters
You have a 5-minute window when someone downloads your lead magnet. Strike while they're hot or lose them forever.

### The First 24 Hours Blueprint

#### **Touchpoint 1: Instant Delivery (0 minutes)**
**Channel:** Email  
**Purpose:** Deliver what they signed up for + set expectations

**Template:**
```
Subject: Your Catalyst Score Results Are Ready 🎯

Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking The Catalyst Score™!

Your results are attached/linked below:
[RESULTS LINK]

Here's what happens next:
- Tomorrow: I'll share [specific value]
- Day 3: [Another specific value]
- Day 7: [Final specific value]

Check your inbox daily - I'm going to help you fix your #1 bottleneck.

[Your Name]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Deliver instantly (within 60 seconds of opt-in)
- Include their specific result (bottleneck phase) if possible
- Set clear expectations for what's coming

#### **Touchpoint 2: Welcome Video (15 minutes)**
**Channel:** Email (embedded video or link)  
**Purpose:** Build connection, deliver quick win

**Video Structure (3-5 minutes):**
1. **Intro (30s):** "Hey [Name], welcome! I'm [Your Name]..."
2. **Context (1min):** "You just took The Catalyst Score and discovered your bottleneck is [Phase]"
3. **Quick Win (2min):** "Here's one thing you can do TODAY to improve..."
4. **Next Steps (1min):** "Over the next week, I'm going to send you..."

**Why Video Works:**
- 10x higher engagement than text-only
- Builds trust faster (they see/hear you)
- Filters out non-serious leads (committed people watch)

#### **Touchpoint 3: SMS/Text (1 hour)**
**Channel:** SMS (if phone number captured)  
**Purpose:** Multi-channel reinforcement

**Template:**
```
Hi [Name], it's [Your Name] 👋

Just wanted to make sure you got your Catalyst Score results. Check your email inbox (might be in spam).

If you have questions, just reply to this text.

[Your Name]
[YourWebsite.com]
```

**Opt-Out Note:** Always include "Reply STOP to opt out" for compliance.

#### **Touchpoint 4: Retargeting Ad (2-24 hours)**
**Channel:** Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn Ads  
**Purpose:** Stay top-of-mind across platforms

**Ad Creative:**
- Image: Your face + "Hey [Custom Audience Name]!"
- Copy: "You just took The Catalyst Score - here's what to do next..."
- CTA: Link back to results page or next step video

## COMPONENT 2: ASSESS & QUALIFY

### What It Is
The process of determining which leads are ready to buy, which need more nurturing, and which to deprioritize.

### Why It Matters
Not all leads are equal. Treating a 20% fit the same as an 80% fit wastes time and money.

### The 3-Tier Qualification System

#### **Tier 1: Hot Leads (Sales-Ready)**
**Criteria:**
- Scored 60+ points in CRM lead scoring
- Opened 5+ emails in first week
- Visited pricing/services page 2+ times
- Matches ICP exactly (budget, authority, need, timing)

**Action:** Direct outreach within 24 hours
- Personal email from you (not automated)
- Invitation to book discovery call
- Phone call if you have their number

#### **Tier 2: Warm Leads (Nurture-Ready)**
**Criteria:**
- Scored 30-59 points
- Opened 2-4 emails
- Some engagement but not sales-ready

**Action:** Continue automated nurture sequence
- Education-focused content
- Case studies & social proof
- Soft CTAs (webinars, resources, not direct sales)

#### **Tier 3: Cold Leads (Disengaged)**
**Criteria:**
- Scored <30 points
- Opened 0-1 emails
- No website activity

**Action:** Re-engagement campaign (see Component 3)
- One last attempt to win them back
- If still no engagement → move to archive

### Lead Scoring Formula (0-100 Points)

**Behavior Scoring:**
- Downloaded lead magnet: +20
- Opened welcome email: +10
- Clicked link in email: +15
- Visited website 2+ times: +10
- Visited pricing page: +25
- Booked discovery call: +40

**Firmographic Scoring (ICP Match):**
- Right industry: +10
- Right revenue range: +10
- Right company size: +10
- Decision-maker title: +10

**Engagement Decay:**
- No activity in 14 days: -10 points/week
- No activity in 30 days: Move to re-engagement

**Automation:** Most CRMs (HubSpot, ActiveCampaign, GoHighLevel) can automate this scoring.

## COMPONENT 3: RESPOND & NURTURE

### What It Is
The ongoing communication that keeps leads engaged, educated, and moving toward a buying decision.

### Why It Matters
Most leads aren't ready to buy on Day 1. The fortune is in the follow-up.

## COMPONENT 4: MOMENTUM BUILDING

### What It Is
Tactics that create forward motion, urgency, and commitment from leads.

### Why It Matters
Leads who take action (even small steps) are far more likely to become clients. Create micro-commitments.

### The 5 Momentum Tactics

#### **1. The Micro-Commitment Ladder**
Get leads to say "yes" to small things before asking for the sale.

**Step 1:** Download lead magnet ✅  
**Step 2:** Watch welcome video ✅  
**Step 3:** Reply to email ✅  
**Step 4:** Book discovery call ✅  
**Step 5:** Attend discovery call ✅  
**Step 6:** Review proposal ✅  
**Step 7:** Sign contract ✅  

Each "yes" makes the next one easier.

#### **2. The 2-Question Qualifier**
Send this email on Day 7:

**Subject:** "Quick question (takes 30 seconds)"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question:

1. On a scale of 1-10, how much of a priority is fixing your [Bottleneck Phase] right now?

2. If I could show you how to solve it in 90 days, would you want to see how?

Just reply with two numbers (e.g., "8, yes").

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Low friction (2 numbers)
- Reveals intent & urgency
- Opens conversation naturally

#### **3. The Calendar Link Strategy**
Make booking a call as easy as possible.

**Best Practices:**
- Use Calendly, TidyCal, or similar
- Show YOUR availability (don't make them suggest times)
- Offer 15-min, 30-min, 60-min options
- Include calendar link in EVERY email after Day 7
- Add calendar link to email signature

#### **4. The Deadline/Scarcity Play**
Create urgency through:

**Limited Capacity:**
> "I only take 3 new clients per month. March has 1 spot left."

**Seasonal Deadline:**
> "Want to hit your Q2 goals? We need to start by March 15th."

**Bonus Expiry:**
> "Book a call this week and get [Bonus] free (normally £500)."

**Ethical Scarcity Only:** Don't lie. If you have limited capacity, say so. If you don't, don't fake it.

#### **5. The Re-Engagement Campaign**
For leads gone cold (no activity in 30+ days):

**Email Subject:** "Should I close your file?"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I haven't heard from you in a while, so I wanted to check in.

Are you still interested in fixing your [Bottleneck Phase]?

If yes → reply "YES" and let's schedule a call
If no → reply "NO" and I'll remove you from my follow-up list
If not now → reply "LATER" and I'll check back in 3 months

Thanks for letting me know!
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Gives them an out (reduces guilt)
- Re-engages those who got busy
- Cleans your list (removes dead weight)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ❌ **Slow Welcome:** Waiting hours/days to send first email
2. ❌ **No Video:** Missing the trust-building power of video
3. ❌ **One Channel Only:** Email-only nurturing (stack channels!)
4. ❌ **Too Salesy Too Soon:** Pitching before building trust
5. ❌ **No Re-Engagement:** Letting cold leads die without one last attempt

---

## AI AGENT DEPLOYMENT (ACTIVATE Phase)

**Primary Agents:**
- **Momentum:** Email sequence automation & SMS campaigns
- **Zenith:** Nurture strategy & timing optimization
- **Narrative:** Email copywriting & video scripts

**What They Do:**
- Write personalized email sequences
- Optimize send times based on engagement data
- A/B test subject lines & CTAs
- Monitor engagement & trigger next actions

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (ACTIVATE Phase)

Your W.A.R.M System™ is working when:
- ✅ 60%+ of leads open welcome email within 24 hours
- ✅ 40%+ of leads engage with 3+ emails in first 30 days
- ✅ 10%+ of leads book discovery calls
- ✅ You can predict which leads will convert based on behavior

**When to Move to Next Phase:** When leads are booking calls but not converting → bottleneck shifts to ACQUIRE.
