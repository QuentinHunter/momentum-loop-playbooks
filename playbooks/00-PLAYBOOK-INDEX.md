2. Build foundation, then add AMPLIFY
3. Once clients are succeeding, add ASCEND → ADVOCATE

**For Growing Businesses (£100K-£500K):**
1. Run The Catalyst Score™ to identify bottleneck
2. Fix bottleneck phase first (usually ACTIVATE or ACQUIRE)
3. Then work sequentially to optimize all phases

**For Scaling Businesses (£500K+):**
1. Optimize all phases simultaneously
2. Use playbooks as SOPs for team training
3. Focus on ASCEND + ADVOCATE for compounding growth
