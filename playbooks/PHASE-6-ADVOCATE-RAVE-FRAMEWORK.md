# PHASE 6: ADVOCATE (Referral & Loop)
## The R.A.V.E Framework™ Playbook

**Purpose:** Turn satisfied clients into a predictable, compounding growth engine (referrals + reviews + reputation)

**Core Problem Solved:** No referrals, inconsistent word-of-mouth, weak reputation systems, under-leveraged client base

---

## THE R.A.V.E FRAMEWORK™ OVERVIEW

```
R - Request (Systematic Referral Asks)
A - Amplify (Proof Capture & Distribution)
V - Virality (Shareability & Network Effects)
E - Evangelize (Ambassadors, Partners & Scalable Advocacy)
```

**When to Deploy:** When you have happy clients but referrals/reviews/testimonials are inconsistent, or growth is still dependent on paid acquisition.

---

## THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**Referrals are not an event. They’re a system.**

Advocacy compounds because:
- A great experience creates promoters
- Promoters create referrals
- Referrals convert better and cheaper
- Higher margins let you reinvest in experience
- The loop accelerates

Your job is to **engineer advocacy**—not hope for it.

---

## COMPONENT 1: REQUEST (Systematic Referral Asks)

### What It Is
A consistent, structured way to ask for introductions at the right moment, with the right wording, and minimal friction.

### Why It Matters
Most businesses don’t ask, ask at the wrong time, or make it awkward. The best time to ask is when value is fresh.

### The 5 Best Moments to Ask

1. **After a Quick Win (Days 7-14)**
   - They feel momentum and optimism

2. **After a Measurable Result (Milestone Hit)**
   - Revenue up, leads up, problem solved

3. **After Praise (They Compliment You)**
   - "This has been amazing" → ask immediately

4. **At Renewal/Upgrade**
   - They reaffirm commitment

5. **At Graduation / Completion**
   - Transformation is clear

### The Referral Ask Script (Clean & Professional)

**Script A: The Direct Ask (Best for B2B services)**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick question.

Do you know 1-2 other [ideal client type] who are struggling with [specific bottleneck] and would benefit from a system like The Momentum Loop™?

If you introduce us, I’ll look after them the way I’ve looked after you.

If someone comes to mind, just reply with their name and I’ll send a short intro message you can forward.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Script B: The Easy Intro (Lowest friction)**
```
If it helps, here’s a simple intro you can copy/paste:

"Hey [Friend], I’ve been working with [You] on our growth systems. If you want, take this 5-min assessment—it will show your #1 bottleneck instantly: [Link]"
```

**Script C: The “Who Do You Know?” Prompt (Unlocks networks)**
```
Who do you know that:
- runs a [type of firm]
- wants [desired outcome]
- but is stuck with [bottleneck]

One name is perfect.
```

### Incentives (Use Carefully)
In professional services, incentives can feel “salesy.” Use **value-based** incentives.

**Good incentive options:**
- Donate £100 to a charity of their choice per referral
- Free strategy session for every successful referral
- VIP access to your template vault for 3 months

**Avoid:** heavy cash bounties (can cheapen perception in accountancy circles)

### The Referral Workflow (No Awkwardness)

1. Ask
2. They give a name
3. You send a pre-written intro
4. They forward
5. You respond within 10 minutes
6. You book the call
7. You thank the referrer (same day)
8. You reward the referrer (if applicable)

**Speed matters:** Referral leads go cold fast if you don’t respond.

## COMPONENT 2: AMPLIFY (Proof Capture & Distribution)

### What It Is
Systematically capturing proof (reviews, testimonials, case studies) and distributing it everywhere prospects make decisions.

### Why It Matters
Proof reduces perceived risk. Distribution multiplies conversion rates in every earlier phase.

### Proof Types (Ranked by Power)
1. **Video testimonials** (best)
2. **Case studies with numbers**
3. **Screenshots of results**
4. **Written testimonials with name/photo/company**
5. **Star ratings (Google, Trustpilot)**

### The Proof Capture Engine (Automated)

**Trigger points:**
- After milestone
- After renewal
- After “thank you” message
- After NPS survey score 9-10

**NPS Prompt (2 questions):**
1) “How likely are you to recommend us?” (0-10)
2) “What’s the main reason for your score?”

**Automation Rules:**
- If score 9-10 → send testimonial + referral request
- If score 7-8 → ask what would make it a 9-10
- If score 0-6 → escalate support immediately

### The Testimonial Capture Formats

**A) 3-Question Written Testimonial**
- Before
- Breakthrough
- After

**B) 10-Min Video Testimonial (Zoom/Loom)**
- Record, then edit into:
  - 15s clip
  - 60s clip
  - 3-5 min full story

**C) “Numbers First” Proof Snapshot**
- “We went from X to Y in Z days”
- Includes screenshot if possible

### Proof Distribution Map (Where it must live)

**High-intent decision points:**
- Sales page
- Booking page (Calendly)
- Proposal PDF
- Payment page

**Mid-intent channels:**
- Email sequences
- Webinars
- LinkedIn posts

**Low-intent channels:**
- Website blog
- YouTube shorts
- Podcast snippets

**Rule:** Every sales asset should have proof within 20 seconds of attention.

## COMPONENT 3: VIRALITY (Shareability & Network Effects)

### What It Is
Designing your assets and experiences so clients naturally share them—creating network effects.

### Why It Matters
Referrals scale linearly. Viral loops can scale exponentially.

### The 4 Viral Loops (B2B-Friendly)

#### 1) **Diagnostic Sharing Loop (Quiz Loop)**
Clients share the quiz because it helps others.

**Make sharing effortless:**
- “Share your score” button
- Pre-written LinkedIn post template
- Email forward template

**Template:**
> “I just took The Catalyst Score™ and discovered our bottleneck is ACTIVATE. If you run a practice and want to find yours, here’s the link: [URL]”

#### 2) **Community Loop**
Create a private group where members invite peers.

**Mechanism:**
- Monthly “guest pass” (bring one friend)
- Member spotlights (status increases sharing)

#### 3) **Content Co-Creation Loop**
Turn client wins into content with them.

**Mechanism:**
- Joint LinkedIn Live
- Co-authored case study
- “Client of the Month” feature

Clients share because it makes THEM look good.

#### 4) **Partner Loop**
Build referral partnerships with adjacent professionals.

**Examples (accountancy niche):**
- IFAs, mortgage brokers, solicitors, HR consultancies

**Mechanism:**
- Co-host webinars
- Shared lead magnet
- Mutual referral agreements
