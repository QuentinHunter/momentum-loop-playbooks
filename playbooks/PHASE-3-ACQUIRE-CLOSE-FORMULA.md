# PHASE 3: ACQUIRE (First Transaction)
## The C.L.O.S.E Formula™ Playbook

**Purpose:** Convert qualified leads into paying clients at scale with predictable, ethical sales systems

**Core Problem Solved:** Low conversion rates, long sales cycles, price objections, inconsistent closing

---

## THE C.L.O.S.E FORMULA™ OVERVIEW

```
C - Clarity (Offer Simplicity & Positioning)
L - Leverage (Proof, Authority & Social Validation)
O - Objections (Preemptive Handling & Risk Reversal)
S - Scarcity (Urgency Mechanisms & Deadlines)
E - Ease (Friction Reduction & Path to Purchase)
```

**When to Deploy:** When you're generating qualified leads and conversations but struggling to close deals or conversion rates are below 20%.

---

## COMPONENT 1: CLARITY (Offer Simplicity & Positioning)

### What It Is
Crystal-clear offer architecture that makes the buying decision obvious and removes confusion.

### Why It Matters
Confused prospects don't buy. Every additional option, feature, or choice you add reduces conversion. Clarity = Conversions.

### The Offer Clarity Framework

#### **1. The Value Equation (Perceived Value Formula)**

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) 
        ÷ (Time Delay + Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Maximize the top:** Bigger promise + higher credibility  
**Minimize the bottom:** Faster results + less work required

**Example Transformation:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Marketing consulting for accountancy practices"
- ✅ **After:** "Generate 10 qualified £10K+ clients in 90 days using The Momentum Loop™ without hiring expensive agencies or spending 20 hours/week on marketing"

**What Changed:**
- Dream Outcome: "10 qualified £10K+ clients" (specific number)
- Likelihood: "The Momentum Loop™" (proprietary system = credibility)
- Time Delay: "90 days" (fast)
- Effort: "without hiring agencies or 20 hrs/week" (low effort)

#### **2. The 3-Tier Offer Architecture**

Never offer just ONE option. Always present 3 tiers (decoy pricing psychology).

**Tier 1: ENTRY (Tripwire/Self-Service)**
- **Price:** £500-£2,000
- **Format:** DIY course, templates, tools
- **Support:** Minimal (community access, email support)
- **Purpose:** Convert "maybe" prospects, fund ad spend, qualify buyers

**Example:** "The Momentum Loop™ Foundations Course"
- Self-paced video training
- Templates & worksheets
- Private community access
- £997 one-time

**Tier 2: CORE (Sweet Spot)**
- **Price:** £3,000-£10,000
- **Format:** Done-With-You implementation
- **Support:** Group coaching, weekly calls, 1-on-1 reviews
- **Purpose:** Primary revenue driver, scalable delivery

**Example:** "The Momentum Loop™ 90-Day Implementation Program"
- 12-week guided implementation
- Weekly group coaching calls
- AI agent deployment & setup
- Private Slack channel
- £4,997 (or 3 × £1,797/month)

**Tier 3: PREMIUM (Decoy/VIP)**
- **Price:** £15,000-£50,000+
- **Format:** Done-For-You + consulting
- **Support:** Full implementation, dedicated support
- **Purpose:** Make Tier 2 look like a bargain, serve high-budget clients

**Example:** "The Momentum Loop™ VIP Intensive"
- Done-for-you implementation
- Quarterly strategy days
- Direct access to you
- £25,000 (or £7,500/quarter)

**Decoy Pricing Effect:**
- Most people choose the middle option (Tier 2)
- Tier 3 makes Tier 2 look affordable by comparison
- Tier 1 anchors the low end and qualifies serious buyers

#### **3. The Irresistible Offer Stack**

Your offer isn't just the core program. It's everything bundled together.

**Stack Formula:**
1. **Core Offer** (the main thing they're buying)
2. **Bonuses** (complementary resources that amplify value)
3. **Guarantees** (risk reversal that removes buying fear)
4. **Scarcity** (urgency that drives action)

**Example Stack:**

```

**Example:**
> "We help UK accountancy practices get 10 new £10K+ clients in 90 days using The Momentum Loop™ without hiring expensive marketing agencies."

**Test:** Say this to 10 people outside your industry. If they can't repeat it back, simplify.

## COMPONENT 2: LEVERAGE (Proof, Authority & Social Validation)

### What It Is
The evidence, credibility, and social proof that makes prospects believe you can deliver the promised outcome.

### Why It Matters
People don't buy from you. They buy from the version of you they perceive based on proof. No proof = no trust = no sale.

### The 7 Types of Leverage

#### **1. Results-Based Proof (The Gold Standard)**

**Case Study Formula:**
- **Before:** Where client started (specific metrics)
- **Challenge:** What stood in their way
- **Solution:** How you solved it (your method)
- **After:** Where they ended up (specific metrics)
- **Timeline:** How long it took

**Example:**
> "ABC Accountancy Practice was generating 2-3 leads per month from referrals, spending £2K/month on ads with no ROI. We deployed The M.A.P System™ in Week 1, activated The W.A.R.M System™ in Week 2, and by Day 45 they had 23 qualified leads and closed 4 new £12K/year clients. Total investment: £4,997. Total return: £48K/year."

**Proof Hierarchy (strongest to weakest):**
1. **Video testimonial** (can see/hear real person)
2. **Written testimonial with photo + full name + company**
3. **Specific result with metrics** ("increased revenue 300%")
4. **Generic testimonial** ("great to work with")

**Minimum Requirements for World-Class Proof:**
- 10+ video testimonials (3-5 minutes each)
- 50+ written testimonials with photos
- 5+ detailed case studies (1,000+ words with charts/graphs)

#### **2. Authority Positioning (Expert Status)**

**The Authority Ladder:**
1. **Practitioner:** "I do this"
2. **Expert:** "I've mastered this and teach it"
3. **Thought Leader:** "I've created a new methodology"
4. **Category King:** "I own this niche"

**How to Climb:**
- **Books:** Author a book (self-published counts)
- **Speaking:** Get on stages (virtual & in-person)
- **Media:** Get featured (podcasts, articles, TV)
- **Awards:** Win industry recognition
- **IP:** Create proprietary frameworks (you have 9!)

**Quick Wins:**
- Publish a book on Amazon (use your UBS as the outline)
- Guest on 10 podcasts in your niche
- Write for industry publications (Accountancy Age, etc.)
- Create a LinkedIn "Top Voice" badge

#### **3. Social Proof (Herd Mentality)**

**Types of Social Proof:**
- **Popularity:** "500+ practices use The Momentum Loop™"
- **Expert Endorsement:** "Recommended by [Industry Leader]"
- **Celebrity:** "As seen on [Media Outlet]"
- **Peer:** "Join 200 other accountancy practice owners"
- **Wisdom of Crowds:** "4.9/5 stars from 150 reviews"

**Where to Display:**
- Website homepage (hero section)
- Sales pages (throughout, not just at bottom)
- Proposal documents
- Email signatures
- LinkedIn banner

#### **4. Before/After Transformations**

**Visual Proof Beats Written Proof:**
- Screenshot of analytics (leads before/after)
- Chart showing revenue growth
- CRM screenshot showing pipeline increase
- Video walkthrough of results dashboard

**Transformation Grid:**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Monthly Leads | 3 | 27 | 9x |
| Conversion Rate | 10% | 35% | 3.5x |
| Avg Client Value | £5K | £12K | 2.4x |
| **Monthly Revenue** | **£1.5K** | **£113K** | **75x** |

#### **5. Risk Reversal Mechanisms**

**Types of Guarantees:**

**A. Results Guarantee**
> "Generate 10 qualified leads in 90 days or we'll work with you for free until you do."

**B. Money-Back Guarantee**
> "If you implement The Momentum Loop™ for 90 days and don't see measurable improvement, we'll refund 100% of your investment."

**C. Performance Guarantee**
> "If we don't deliver [specific outcome], you don't pay."

**D. Partial Refund / Satisfaction Guarantee**
> "Not satisfied after 30 days? Get 50% back, keep all the materials."

**Which to Use:**
- **Results Guarantee:** Best for service businesses (low refund risk if you vet clients)
- **Money-Back:** Best for courses/products (higher refund risk but boosts conversions)
- **Performance:** Best for agencies/done-for-you (only if you control execution)

**Psychology:** The stronger your guarantee, the fewer people use it. It filters for serious buyers.

#### **6. Third-Party Validation**

**Borrowed Credibility:**
- Industry certifications (ICAEW, ACCA endorsement)
- Software partnerships (GoHighLevel Certified, HubSpot Partner)
- Media features ("As Seen On" logos)
- Event speaking (TEDx, industry conferences)
- Published research (white papers, studies)

**Quick Win:** Get certified in tools you already use, display badges on website.

#### **7. Demonstration/Proof of Concept**

**Show, Don't Tell:**
- **Live Demo:** Screen share showing system in action
- **Free Audit:** Analyze their business, show specific gaps
- **Mini-Implementation:** Do part of the work upfront
- **Sandbox Access:** Let them test the tools

**Example: The Catalyst Score™ as Proof**
Your quiz IS a demonstration. It shows your expertise by diagnosing their business for free.

## COMPONENT 3: OBJECTIONS (Preemptive Handling & Risk Reversal)

### What It Is
Addressing every reason someone might NOT buy before they even think of it.

### Why It Matters
Objections aren't problems—they're predictable patterns. Handle them preemptively and you'll close more deals faster.

### The 8 Universal Objections (And How to Destroy Them)

#### **Objection 1: "It's too expensive"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I don't see the value" or "I don't have budget allocated"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Frame as Investment, Not Cost**
   > "This isn't an expense—it's a £4,997 investment that generates £50K+ in new revenue. That's a 10x return."

2. **Break Down the Cost**
   > "£4,997 ÷ 12 weeks = £416/week. You'll generate that from ONE new client."

3. **Compare to Alternatives**
   > "A marketing agency charges £3K/month (£36K/year) and you still do all the work. This is £4,997 one-time and we do it WITH you."

4. **Offer Payment Plans**
   > "3 monthly payments of £1,797. That's £60/day—less than the cost of skipping ONE sales opportunity."

**Advanced Tactic: The ROI Calculator**
Build a simple calculator that shows:
- Investment: £4,997
- Conservative result: 5 new clients × £10K = £50K
- ROI: 901%
- Payback period: 30-45 days

#### **Objection 2: "I need to think about it"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I don't trust you yet" or "I need to justify this to someone else"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Create Urgency**
   > "I completely understand. However, we only take 3 clients per month and I have 2 spots left. If you need time, I can hold a spot for 48 hours, but after that I can't guarantee availability until May."

2. **Isolate the Real Objection**
   > "Is it really time you need, or is there something specific I haven't addressed? Let's talk through it now."

3. **Provide Decision Framework**
   > "Here's a simple way to decide: If you could fix your [bottleneck] in 90 days and generate an extra £50K this year, would £4,997 be worth it? If yes, the only question is timing."

#### **Objection 3: "I've tried this before and it didn't work"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I'm skeptical because I've been burned"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Acknowledge & Differentiate**
   > "I hear that a lot. Most agencies throw spaghetti at the wall and hope something sticks. The Momentum Loop™ is different—it's a diagnostic-first approach. We find YOUR specific bottleneck, not a generic solution."

2. **Show Why They Failed**
   > "The reason most marketing fails for accountancy practices is [specific reason]. That's why we built [specific solution]."

3. **Guarantee Results**
   > "That's exactly why we have the 90-Day Guarantee. If this doesn't work, you don't pay."

#### **Objection 4: "I don't have time to implement this"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I'm overwhelmed and don't want another thing on my plate"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Position as Time-Saver**
   > "That's the beauty of The Momentum Loop™—we do the heavy lifting. Setup takes 2 hours/week for 4 weeks, then it runs on autopilot. Compare that to 20 hours/week of manual prospecting."

2. **Show What Happens If They Don't**
   > "You're right—you don't have time. That's the problem. You're stuck in feast-or-famine because you're too busy delivering to focus on growth. This fixes that."

3. **Offer Done-For-You Option**
   > "If time is truly the issue, we have a VIP Done-For-You tier where we implement everything. Investment is £25K. Which makes more sense for you?"

#### **Objection 5: "I need to talk to my business partner / spouse / accountant"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I'm not the sole decision-maker"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Qualify Early**
   > "Before we dive in, who else is involved in decisions like this? Let's get them on the call so we only do this once."

2. **Provide Decision Package**
   > "Totally understand. Here's a one-page summary you can share with [partner]. It covers the investment, expected return, and guarantee. Let's schedule a 15-minute call with both of you tomorrow."

3. **Create Urgency**
   > "I respect that. However, the 3 spots I have for March will likely be gone by end of week. If you're serious, I'd recommend discussing tonight and circling back tomorrow."

#### **Objection 6: "What if it doesn't work for my business?"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I'm unique and skeptical this applies to me"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Show Similar Success**
   > "Great question. I've worked with 50+ accountancy practices in the UK—from sole practitioners to 20-person firms. Here's one in [their city] who thought the same thing. [Show case study]."

2. **Diagnose Their Uniqueness**
   > "Let's look at your Catalyst Score. Your bottleneck is [phase]. That's actually the #1 bottleneck for 60% of practices. Here's exactly how we fix it for you."

3. **Guarantee Removes Risk**
   > "That's why we have the guarantee. If it truly doesn't work for your business after 90 days, you get your money back."

#### **Objection 7: "I'm already working with someone"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I'm loyal" or "I don't want to admit my current solution isn't working"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Acknowledge Without Trashing Competitor**
   > "That's great—I'm glad you're investing in growth. Out of curiosity, what's your #1 bottleneck right now according to them?"

2. **Position as Complementary**
   > "We're not replacing your current setup—we're adding The Momentum Loop™ framework on top. Think of us as the strategic layer."

3. **Create Comparison**
   > "If you're happy with your current provider, that's fantastic. But if you're still struggling with [their bottleneck], maybe it's worth a second opinion?"

#### **Objection 8: "Can I start next quarter / next year?"**

**What They Really Mean:** "I'm procrastinating" or "I have other priorities"

**Preemptive Handling:**
1. **Calculate Cost of Delay**
   > "I understand. Let's do the math: If we start today, you'd have 10 new clients by June (£100K in new revenue). If you wait until Q3, you lose £50K+ this year. Is that worth the delay?"

2. **Create Urgency**
   > "Unfortunately, we're fully booked Q2 and have a waitlist for Q3. If you want in this year, March is the window."

3. **Offer Deposit / Hold**
   > "Tell you what—put down a £500 deposit today to hold your spot for Q2 kickoff. That way you lock in and we start planning now."

---

### Objection-Handling Framework: F.E.A.R

**F**eel - Acknowledge their concern  
**E**mpathize - Show you understand  
**A**ddress - Answer directly with proof  
**R**eframe - Position it positively

**Example:**
> **Prospect:** "It's too expensive."  
> **You:** "I totally *feel* that—£4,997 is a significant investment. I *empathize* because I've been there. Here's what I'd *address*: This generates £50K+ in new revenue (10x ROI), and we guarantee results. Let me *reframe* it: You're not spending £5K—you're accessing £50K that's currently locked in your bottleneck. Does that make sense?"

---

### Deliverables (Objections)
- [ ] List of 10-15 most common objections
- [ ] Written response for each (F.E.A.R format)
- [ ] FAQ page on website addressing all objections
- [ ] Objection-handling script for discovery calls

---

## COMPONENT 4: SCARCITY (Urgency Mechanisms & Deadlines)

### What It Is
Legitimate reasons prospects must act NOW rather than "someday."

### Why It Matters
Without urgency, prospects procrastinate indefinitely. Ethical scarcity drives action.

### The 5 Types of Ethical Scarcity

#### **1. Capacity Scarcity (Limited Availability)**

> "I only take 3 new clients per month to ensure quality. 2 spots are already filled for March."

**Why This Works:**
- True (if you structure it this way)
- Implies exclusivity & quality
- Creates FOMO (fear of missing out)

**How to Implement:**
- Cap client intake (don't oversell)
- Show "spots remaining" on sales pages
- Update in real-time ("2 spots left" → "1 spot left")

#### **2. Time-Bound Bonuses (Deadline Incentives)**

> "Book a call this week and get the £997 Catalyst Score™ Setup Kit free (normally an add-on)."

**Why This Works:**
- Reward fast action
- Create immediate loss if they wait
- Increase perceived value

**Bonus Examples:**
- "Free 30-day VIP Vault access" (normally £297)
- "1-on-1 strategy session with me" (normally £500)
- "Priority implementation" (start in 7 days vs. 30 days)

#### **3. Price Increases (Deadline-Driven)**

> "Our current price is £4,997. Effective April 1st, it increases to £6,997. Lock in today at the old rate."

**Why This Works:**
- Tangible loss if they wait (£2K)
- Clear deadline
- Rewards decisiveness

**Best Practices:**
- Announce increase 30 days in advance
- Actually increase the price (don't fake it)
- Grandfather existing clients (builds loyalty)

#### **4. Seasonal/Event-Based Urgency**

> "Want to hit your Q2 revenue goals? We need to start by March 15th (12-week program)."

**Why This Works:**
- Ties to their goals/deadlines
- Logical urgency (not manufactured)
- Helps them justify action to partners

**Examples:**
- "Year-end push" (Oct-Dec)
- "New year planning" (Jan-Feb)
- "Tax season prep" (for accountants: Feb-Mar)
- "Conference season" (speaking circuit deadlines)

#### **5. Opportunity Cost Framing**

> "Every month you wait is another £8K+ in revenue walking past you. What's the cost of delay?"

**Why This Works:**
- Reframes inaction as expensive
- Makes waiting painful
- Shifts from "cost of buying" to "cost of NOT buying"

**Calculation Example:**
- Your offer generates 2 clients/month × £10K = £20K/month
- Waiting 3 months = £60K lost opportunity
- Your investment: £4,997
- **Net loss from waiting: £55K**

### The Urgency Stack (Use Multiple)

**Example Email:**

```
Subject: 1 Spot Left for March

Hi [Name],

Quick update:

We started this week with 3 spots available for March.

As of this morning, 2 are gone.

That means you have 1 spot remaining if you want to:
→ Fix your [bottleneck] in 90 days
→ Start generating £10K+ clients consistently
→ Stop relying on referrals

PLUS: If you book a call by Friday, you'll get the £997 
Catalyst Score™ Setup Kit FREE (I'm removing this bonus 
next week).

Here's what's at stake:
- Wait until April → lose 4+ weeks of implementation
- Skip Q1 → miss £20K+ in Q2 revenue
- Delay until "someday" → stay stuck in feast-famine

Your move: [Calendar Link]

The clock's ticking,
[Your Name]

P.S. Not ready? No worries—I'll check back in 90 days. 
But if you're serious about growth, let's talk this week.

## COMPONENT 5: EASE (Friction Reduction & Path to Purchase)

### What It Is
Making it stupidly simple for prospects to say "yes" and complete the transaction.

### Why It Matters
Every click, form field, or step you add reduces conversions. Friction kills sales.

### The 10 Friction Points to Eliminate

#### **1. Complicated Booking Process**

❌ **High Friction:** "Email me to schedule" or "Fill out this 20-question form"  
✅ **Low Friction:** Direct calendar link (Calendly, TidyCal) embedded everywhere

**Best Practices:**
- Show YOUR availability (don't make them suggest times)
- Offer multiple time slots per day
- Send automatic reminders (reduce no-shows)
- Include calendar link in email signature

#### **2. Too Many Choices**

❌ **High Friction:** "We offer 10 different packages—which one is right for you?"  
✅ **Low Friction:** 3 clear tiers (Entry/Core/Premium) with one recommended

**The Paradox of Choice:**
- 3 options = optimal conversion
- 5+ options = analysis paralysis
- 1 option = no comparison (lower trust)

**Highlight the Recommended Option:**
```
TIER 1: Self-Service | £997
TIER 2: Implementation ⭐ MOST POPULAR | £4,997
TIER 3: VIP Done-For-You | £25,000
```

#### **3. Hidden Pricing**

❌ **High Friction:** "Contact us for pricing" or "Custom quote only"  
✅ **Low Friction:** Transparent pricing on website (even if "starting at £X")

**Why This Matters:**
- Hidden pricing screams "we'll gouge you"
- Wastes time on unqualified leads
- Reduces trust immediately

**When to Hide Pricing:**
- Only if truly custom (Enterprise SaaS, large consulting)
- Even then, show ranges ("£10K-£50K depending on scope")

#### **4. Long Forms**

❌ **High Friction:** 15-field lead capture form  
✅ **Low Friction:** Name + Email (2 fields)

**Form Field Rule:**
- Lead magnet: Name + Email only
- Discovery call: Name + Email + Phone (3 fields max)
- Proposal/contract: Everything required by law

**Every additional field = 5-10% drop in conversions**

#### **5. Payment Friction**

❌ **High Friction:** "Mail us a check" or "Bank transfer only"  
✅ **Low Friction:** Stripe payment link, multiple payment options

**Payment Options to Offer:**
- Credit/debit card (Stripe, PayPal)
- Payment plans (3, 6, 12 months)
- Bank transfer (for those who prefer it)
- Financing (Klarna, Affirm for high-ticket)

**One-Click Checkout:**
Use Stripe Payment Links or similar. Click → Pay → Done.

#### **6. Unclear Next Steps**

❌ **High Friction:** "We'll be in touch soon"  
✅ **Low Friction:** "Here's what happens next: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3"

**Example Post-Call Email:**
```
Subject: Next Steps After Our Call

Hi [Name],

Great chatting today! Here's what happens next:

TODAY: Review the proposal I sent (link below)

TOMORROW: Reply with any questions or concerns

DAY 3: Sign the agreement + make first payment

DAY 4: We'll send your onboarding docs

DAY 5-7: Kickoff call (I'll send calendar invite)

Ready to move forward? Click here to sign & pay: [LINK]

Questions? Just reply to this email.

[Your Name]
```

#### **7. Proposal Complexity**

❌ **High Friction:** 30-page PDF proposal with legal jargon  
✅ **Low Friction:** 1-2 page proposal with clear outcomes

**Proposal Structure:**
- **Page 1:** Problem, Solution, Investment, Timeline
- **Page 2:** Case study, Guarantee, Next steps
- **Signature Block:** DocuSign or PandaDoc (e-sign, not print)

**Proposals Shouldn't Be Read—They Should Be Scanned**
- Use bullet points
- Include visuals (charts, graphics)
- Bold key info (investment, guarantee)

#### **8. Long Sales Cycles**

❌ **High Friction:** 3-4 calls before closing  
✅ **Low Friction:** 1 discovery call → proposal → close (3-7 days)

**Shorten Your Sales Cycle:**
1. **Pre-qualify hard** (use quiz, forms, emails)
2. **Send pre-call resources** (video, case studies)
3. **Pitch on first call** (don't wait for "second meeting")
4. **Same-day proposals** (send within 2 hours of call)
5. **Follow up fast** (next day if no response)

**World-Class Standard:** Discovery call → Close in 48-72 hours

#### **9. Lack of Social Proof at Decision Point**

❌ **High Friction:** Asking for the sale with no trust signals nearby  
✅ **Low Friction:** Testimonials on checkout page, in proposal, in follow-up emails

**Where to Place Social Proof:**
- Checkout/payment page
- Proposal document
- Email signature
- Calendar booking page

#### **10. Analysis Paralysis (Overcomplicated Offers)**

❌ **High Friction:** "Choose your modules, add-ons, and tier"  
✅ **Low Friction:** Pre-packaged bundles

**Example:**
Instead of:
> "Select from 15 modules, 8 add-ons, and 3 support tiers"

Offer:
> "The Momentum Loop™ 90-Day Program (everything you need in one package)"

---

## ADVANCED SALES TACTICS (World-Class Level)

### 1. The Diagnostic Sales Call Framework

**Pre-Call (Before They Even Book):**
- Send Catalyst Score results
- Share 1-2 relevant case studies
- Send short video: "What to expect on our call"

**During Call (60-90 minutes):**

**Part 1: Discovery (30 min)**
- Review their Catalyst Score (bottleneck)
- Ask about goals (revenue, clients, timeline)
- Uncover pain (what's the cost of NOT fixing this?)
- Qualify (budget, authority, need, timing)

**Part 2: Prescription (20 min)**
- Explain how The Momentum Loop™ solves their specific bottleneck
- Walk through relevant case study
- Show what the 90-day plan looks like

**Part 3: Offer (10 min)**
- Present 3-tier pricing
- Recommend best-fit tier
- Handle objections preemptively
- Ask for the sale

**Post-Call (Within 2 hours):**
- Send proposal (1-2 pages)
- Include payment link
- Set deadline (48-72 hours)

### 2. The "Take-Away" Close

**When They're On the Fence:**
> "Based on what you've told me, I'm not sure this is the right fit. You mentioned [concern], and that tells me you might not be ready to commit fully. I only work with clients who are 100% in. What do you think?"

**Why This Works:**
- Reverses psychology (they sell themselves)
- Shows you're not desperate
- Filters out time-wasters

### 3. The Assumptive Close

**Instead of:**
> "So, would you like to move forward?"

**Say:**
> "Great! I'm going to send the agreement and payment link. You'll get started on Monday. Which tier makes more sense—Core or VIP?"

**Notice:** You're assuming the sale and just clarifying details.

### 4. The Trial Close (Test Waters)

**Throughout the call, ask:**
- "Does that make sense so far?"
- "Can you see this working for your business?"
- "If we could deliver [outcome], would that be worth [investment]?"

**Green Lights:** "Yes" answers = ready to close  
**Red Lights:** "Maybe" or hesitation = more discovery needed

### 5. The Puppy Dog Close

> "Tell you what—let's do the first 30 days together. If you're not seeing progress, we'll pause and refund you. But I'm confident you'll want to continue. Sound fair?"

**Why This Works:**
- Low-risk trial period
- They experience value before fully committing
- Most won't refund (momentum bias)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ❌ **Pitching Before Discovery:** Selling without understanding their needs
2. ❌ **Weak Guarantees:** "We'll try our best" (meaningless)
3. ❌ **No Urgency:** Letting prospects "think about it" indefinitely
4. ❌ **Complicated Offers:** Too many options/add-ons
5. ❌ **Long Sales Cycles:** Taking weeks to close deals

- ✅ Proposals are opened within 24 hours (80%+ open rate)
- ✅ Average deal size is £5K+ (or your target)
